This game is about mining and beating bosses. It's basically Minecraft with a hardcore MMO and First Person Shooter feel.

# How 2 Build

First, you download an IDE of your preference that supports Eclipse importing, and Java (RECOMMENDED: https://jetbrains.com/idea/, https://eclipse.org/download (this is eclipse, you can actually import it if you don't understand the other one)).
Second, import the project in and press the run button or the debug button.
Last, idk do something i guess.
